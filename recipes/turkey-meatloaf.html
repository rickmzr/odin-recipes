    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adding sauteed vegetables to ground turkey breast adds both flavor and moisture to this 
        Tex-Mex-inspired meatloaf. It's a great cooking hack for making low-fat turkey and chicken 
        burgers, too. If you have leftover roasted or grilled peppers and onions in your fridge, you
         can chop them up and add them to the turkey mixture instead of the sauteed veggies.
         Serves eight.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup uncooked yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup reduced fat cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/4 lbs uncooked 99% fat-free ground turkey breast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unpacked light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp yellow mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-X4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic; sauté for 3 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cooled onion mixture, cheese, breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, ketchup, salt, pepper, and egg; toss to moisten the breadcrumbs. Add the turkey; stir just until blended.</li>
        <li>Pack the turkey mixture into the prepared pan; smooth into an even layer. Bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, sugar, and mustard; spread over the meatloaf and bake to an internal temperature of 165°F, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove the meatloaf from the oven; let stand 10 minutes. Remove the meatloaf from that pan; slice it into 6 equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Serving size: 1 piece</li>
    </ol>
