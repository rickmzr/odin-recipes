    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon and dill give this Greek-inspired soup a fresh, bright note. It’s a simple 
        yet tasty way to enjoy Mediterranean flavors and use up leftover cooked chicken. 
        Stir in the quick-cooking orzo, a small-shaped pasta that has a grain-like appearance, 
        during the last 8 to 10 minutes of cooking. Because this recipe makes a big batch, 
        it’s perfect to make for an impromptu casual gathering. Accompany with a Greek salad 
        and warm pita bread for a full meal. Serves eight.</p>
