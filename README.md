# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website

This project is the first website made in the Project Odin curriculum.
The goal is to practice HTML basics, along with reinforcing proper
version control practices.

I added some of my family's favorite recipes and practiced using lists
as well as basic HTML tags and proper file structure.
